# get_next_line is an individual project at 42
Function written in C which gets each new line from file

The goal is to get better at C using only three standard library functions:

read
malloc
free

This project gives clear understanding of pointers, static variables, linked lists, memory leaks and file descriptors.

To try it you can use library (in neibourhood repository), some text file and main.c file. You'll also gonna need MacOS.
